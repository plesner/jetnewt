# Utility for extracting timetables from rejseplanen.dk. This script runs a
# pipeline that extracts timetable information based on queries to the REST api.
# It is quite gentle -- it is rate limited, never asks for the same url twice.
# The strategy is as follows.
#
#   1. The configuration specifies a small number of _hub_ stops/stations. These
#      are places that, between them, all the routes of interest pass through.
#   2. For each hub a list of all arrivals and departures for some particular
#      day are requested. For each arrival we record the name of the route and
#      the start point, for each destination we record the name and the end
#      point. Since all routes of interest pass through some hub this will give
#      us the start and end points of all routes of interest.
#   3. For each station that is a start point we fetch all departures. For each
#      end point we fetch all arrivals. This will give us the full extent of
#      all the routes we're interested in.
#   4. For each arrival and departure of a route we're interested in at a
#      terminus, fetch the journey details which give all the times and stops
#      for that trip.
#
# For clarity, here's the terminology used in the code.
#
#   Stop: a location where you can get on or off. Stops have a unique string
#     name, ie. "Aarhus H", and a unique string ID, ie. "008600053".
#
#   Route: A named transport route, ie. "Bus 2A". The name of a route doesn't
#     tell you where it can transport you -- each typically has at least two
#     directions, for instance, so routes are more used for organization than
#     for semantics.
#
#   Sub-route: Each route has a number of sub-routes which do tell you where
#     you can be transported. For instance, the route "Bus 2A" has two
#     sub-routes, one for each direction. But they can also have more, for
#     instance if the route alternates destinations between trips.
#
#   Journey: an instance of a sub-route at a particular time. A sub-route is
#     timeless, it's a start and endpoint and the stops and times in between,
#     whereas a journey happens at a concrete time and exactly once.
#
#   Transit: the arrival or departure of a vehicle at a stop. A transit happens
#     at a particular place at a particular time. Arrivals and departures have
#     slightly different information associated with them so we sometimes need
#     to distinguish between them, but often they can be treated together as
#     generic transits.
#
#   Terminus: the start or end of a sub-route. A terminus can be both a start
#     and end at the same time (they typically are).
#
#   Board: a list of arrivals or departures at a particular stop. Like transits,
#     sometimes the two types have to be handled separately but when they're
#     handled together they're called boards.
