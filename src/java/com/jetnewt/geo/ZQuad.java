/**
 * A z-quad is a 64-bit quantity that identifies a regular square sub-
 * division of a square space. Here's an illustration of the first 3 zoom
 * levels,
 *
 *       zoom = 0            zoom = 1            zoom = 2
 *   +---------------+   +-------+-------+   +---+---+---+---+
 *   |               |   |       |       |   | 5 | 6 | 9 | 10|
 *   |               |   |   1   |   2   |   +---+---+---+---+
 *   |               |   |       |       |   | 7 | 8 | 11| 12|
 *   |       0       |   +-------+-------+   +---+---+---+---+
 *   |               |   |       |       |   | 13| 14| 17| 18|
 *   |               |   |   3   |   4   |   +---+---+---+---+
 *   |               |   |       |       |   | 15| 16| 19| 20|
 *   +---------------+   +-------+-------+   +---+---+---+---+
 *
 * So 0 represents the whole space, 1 represents the top left corner of the
 * space, and so on. The greater the value the smaller and more accurate the
 * space it represents. Note that at zoom level 2 the indices don't move
 * straight across, they move in zig-zag finishing each quad from the previous
 * zoom level before moving on to the next one, so 5-8 at zoom 2 cover 1 from
 * zoom 1, and so forth.
 *
 * This class provides static methods for manipulating quads directly as 64-bit
 * longs. So you don't create instances of this class, the instances are longs.
 *
 * A bit of terminology used in the implementation. The relations between quads
 * are the following.
 *
 *   * Given a quad its _parent_ is the containing quad at the zoom level above.
 *     So the parent of 14 is 3, the parent of 3 is 0.
 *   * If B is a parent of A then A is a _child_ of B. So 3 is a child of 0 and
 *     14 is a child of 3.
 *   * A quad A is an _ancestor_ of another quad B if A and B are equal or A is
 *     an ancestor of B's parent. So 0, 3, and 14 are all ancestors of 14 but
 *     only 3 is the parent of 14.
 *   * B is a _descendant_ of A if A is an ancestor of B. So 0, 3, and 14 are
 *     all descendants of 0.
 *   * Given a quad B and an ancestor A, the _descendancy_ between A and B is
 *     the quad that indicates the location of B within A. For instance, the
 *     descendancy of 14 within 3 is 2 because if you look only at 3 then 14 is
 *     at its quad 2.
 *
 * Terminology around the implementation,
 *
 *   * For a given zoom level the _bias_ is the value of the first quad at that
 *     level. The 0th bias is 0, the 1st is 1, the 2nd is 5, the 3rd is 21,
 *     etc.
 *   * The _scalar_ value of a quad is the quad's value minus the bias for that
 *     quad's zoom level. For example, values at zoom level 2 are 5-20, the
 *     scalars are 0-15. There are 4^z scalars at zoom level z.
 *
 * The name, z-quad, comes from the fact that going between a quad and its
 * descendants and ancestors ("zooming in and out") is inexpensive, and the
 * zig-zag pattern of numbering.
 *
 * For a lot of operations you need to know the quad's zoom level explicitly.
 * It is not super expensive to calculate but it's not trivial either and often
 * you'll already know the zoom so it's a waste to recalculate it, so for
 * those operations two functions exist: one that calculates the zoom itself
 * and one that takes it as an argument.
